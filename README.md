Athletic Emergency Alert System, for large sports complexes.
The purpose of the athletic EMAS(Emergency Medical Alert System) is to enable people who may need medical assistance to get the help they need by contacting on-site medical personnel using a radio channel. This could be an essential part of your sports complex, no matter what the sport. Contact me if you are interested in this product at greysonhubler@gmail.com!

Project Name: Athletic EMAS
Creator: Greyson Hubler

Goal:
Create a program for sports complexes that enables contact with onsite medical personnel in an emergency. There are times in a sports complex where there is no one around to assist you in case of an emergency like this. Now, with the new concept, you can alert someone of a serious medical emergency when you need it the most. 

Concept:
Button → Sensors → Radio Broadcast and Monitoring Device
This will allow faster responses in dire situations where someone(player, coach, referee, parent) may need assistance. This button can also have a security feature where it can signal for help in need of someone trying to attack a player, coach, or referee, or when a game feels unsafe or insecure.

Items Needed:
Radio
Button
Transmitting Sensors
Computer Program

Programming Needs:
Creating the advertisement page
Creating the page for users
Creating a program for the radios to work on
